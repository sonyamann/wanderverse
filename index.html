	<p>Welcome to Wanderverse. You've come upon a sunny meadow in the woods, full of wildflowers and fat, fuzzy bumblebees flying loops-de-loops. Here is the center, the start, the seed. Everyone must begin at the beginning.</p>

	<p>Through the grass you see the overgrown, softened pattern of a labyrinth. Once upon a time someone shaped it. They mounded up the earth painstakingly. Who was it, who did that? Never mind for now.</p>
